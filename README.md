Criteria Two calls for the navigation to scroll to that section. I took it a bit further and made each section its own HTML page. At the root, this process equates to the same thing. See the code below.

Criteria Three is met with the below HTML code. This is remarkably similar to Criteria Two, except it is specifically targeting the portfolio section. Also, the portfolio section had been setup with titled images per the prompt.
