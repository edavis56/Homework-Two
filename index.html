            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Eric Davis, I was born and raised in the Atlanta metropolitan area. I attended Kennesaw State University where I studied Accounting. After receiving my bachelor’s in accounting, I went on to work for Coca-Cola in Brandon, Florida. Two years into my first job after college, I began my journey towards earning my master’s in accounting. While in the master’s program, I decided to move back to Atlanta and began working at Home Depot. I then decided to move to a smaller organization to gain further insight into general ledger accounting. I continued work as an accountant, but felt I needed a change. This lead me to the Georgia Tech Bootcamp!

                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.
