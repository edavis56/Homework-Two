            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Eric Davis, I was born and raised in the Atlanta metropolitan area. I attended Kennesaw State University where I studied Accounting. After receiving my bachelor’s in accounting, I went on to work for Coca-Cola in Brandon, Florida. Two years into my first job after college, I began my journey towards earning my master’s in accounting. While in the master’s program, I decided to move back to Atlanta and began working at Home Depot. I then decided to move to a smaller organization to gain further insight into general ledger accounting. I continued work as an accountant, but felt I needed a change. This lead me to the Georgia Tech Bootcamp!

                I attend at least one Chiefs home game a year. With all the success the team has had, I have had the opportunity of attending the past two AFC championships.

                Being from Northwest Georgia, I am surrounded by many mountain trails. I take full advantage of this by hiking as often as I can. This has been one of my favorite activities since high school.
